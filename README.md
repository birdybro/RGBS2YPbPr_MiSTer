# RGBS2YPbPr_MiSTer
Just a fun simple external adapter so you don't have to mod your AG620x-based HDMI to VGA Direct video Adapter for YPbPr

I changed the name of the project partway through making it. This is an amateurly designed untested board currently, I'm making a few eventually when boards get here from JLCPCB.
